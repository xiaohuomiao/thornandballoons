Some people play with a 4 x 4 grid, but that is for more advanced players, and we will focus on the 3 x 3 grid here.\n\nHave the first player go first. Though traditionally, the first player goes with \"X\", you can allow the first player to decide whether to go with \"X\"s or to go with \"O\"s. These symbols will be placed on the table, in an attempt to have three of them in a row. If you're going first, then the best move you can make is to move into the center. This will maximize your chances of winning since you'll be able to create a row of three \"X\"s or \"O\"s in more combinations (4) this way than if you chose a different square.\n\nHave the second player go second. After the first player goes, then the second player should put down his symbol, which will be different from the symbol of the first player. The second player can either try to block the first player from creating a row of three or focus on creating their row of three. Ideally, the player can do both.",
