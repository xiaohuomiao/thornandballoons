You will have a row of cars of mixed colors: brown, red, yellow, and blue, but your goal is to park cars of the same color in the same row, so all red cars are parked in one row, brown cars in one row, and so on.\n\nThere are several rows that are empty - you need to fill these rows strategically. Once you place a color in an empty row, you have to add the same color in that row. Cars cannot be placed in front of cars of different colors, so once you start a row, make sure you have a plan to fill it.\n\nWhen you fill up an entire row with one color, the row is locked. Lock them all and complete the stage.",
